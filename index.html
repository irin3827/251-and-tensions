    <h1><a href="index.html">2-5-1 Voicing</a></h1>
    <p>The ii–V–I progression ("two–five–one progression") (occasionally referred to as ii–V–I turnaround, and ii–V–I) is a common cadential chord progression used in a wide variety of music genres, including jazz harmony. It is a succession of chords whose roots descend in fifths from the second degree (supertonic) to the fifth degree (dominant), and finally to the tonic. In a major key, the supertonic triad (ii) is minor, and in a minor key it is diminished. The dominant is, in its normal form, a major triad and commonly a dominant seventh chord. With the addition of chord alterations, substitutions, and extensions, limitless variations exist on this simple formula.</p>
    <p>There are <strong>8 tensions</strong> of 2-5-1 voicing and they are made by the transition of 5 dominant. <strong>Don't be afraid.</strong> You could get used to them with your contant practice.</p>
